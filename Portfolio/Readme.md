## Part1 - Ideation and Research

### Basic ideation

Braining storming about the final project topic and possible ideas.

I want to do something related to Digital pollution (pollution behind our digital activities)

Mainly have four ideations：

**Digital activities management tools**

For reducing the digital pollution like helping users to manage their daily digital activities, but it's too common, less creativity.

**Carbon filter**

A tool can be used as a filter, filtering data and squeeze the website to a basic functions, part like the definition of useful in “low tech”.

**Carbon footprint printer**

installations that can monitor the digital activity among one local server and visualise the carbon footprint-website can changed with different data behaviours. the interface…component…can be affected

**VR Game**

Players would have data transport mission to save a plant or a creature，they embark on an adventure where they navigate a virtual world, engage in daily digital activities, and strive to minimize their virtual carbon footprint. 

### Further Research

During Summer holiday, I focus on the process of making a specific outcome from literature researches.

**What is digital pollution?**

- **What is digital carbon footprint?**
- **How to calculate digital carbon emission?**

Actually, digital carbon footprint is measurable (though the outcome might not precisely), so I try to get some references of “how to calculate digital carbon emission”, and the website “[Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org)” provide some formulas for calculating digital carbon emission.

 **Current status of digital carbon pollution**

Then, I tried to get current status of digital carbon pollution.  

**People's attitude of digital carbon pollution**

- **Questionnaire**
- **Interview**
- **Findings in relevant papers**

Next,to understand people's attitude of digital carbon pollution, I did a questionnaire  with 100 people and made 5 interviews with some volunteers. Combine with some findings in relevant papers, I analysis why people will overlook the effect of digital carbon pollution.

**Why people will overlook the effect of digital carbon pollution**

Here are some reasons:

1. The invisible and abstract nature of digital technologies makes their environmental impacts obscure and intangible to most users.
2. Lack of transparency around the energy usage and carbon emissions of the internet infrastructure underpinning online services.
3. Incorrectly perceiving digital activities as "immaterial" and thus detached from material environmental consequences.
4. Poor mental models and understanding of how everyday digital activities like video streaming are linked to fossil fuel energy use and GHG emissions.
5. Overconfidence in existing measures to address carbon emissions and lack of awareness of the seriousness of the carbon emissions problem.

**The outcome of continuously emit carbon dioxide**

After these process, I did a researched on” the outcome of continuously emit carbon dioxide”, understood that if we don't control our activities, the carbon pollution will ultimately lead to a terrible future.

### Concept development

**Concept brainstorming mind map**

**Final concept**

According to former research, I hope to make something let people realise that digital carbon pollution is a tough environmental problem.

So I came up with 5 ideas with specific concept:

1. **Visualising digital carbon footprint? - too complicated to interact**
    
    By scanning a QR code and posting content on a designated social media platform, I need to record the digital carbon emission generated during this interaction, and there will be a screen displaying a tree/glacier that will wither away as more and more content is posted (and the carbon emission increases).
    
    **Visual reference:**

2. **Carbon scale**
    
    Combining a scale, balloons, and a screen, changes on the screen driven by human behavior can influence the dynamics of the balloons and the scale. This interactive setup makes people aware that their digital activities contribute to carbon emissions and that mitigating carbon emissions is also linked to their actions. While there are some methods to handle carbon emissions currently in place, if individuals do not acknowledge the impact of digital carbon emissions and control their digital habits, existing mitigation efforts will remain merely a drop in the bucket.

3. **Carbon footprint consumption - Not convincing enough.**
    
    Users can scan and upload their own content, which generates a digital carbon footprint, but in order to be carbon-neutral - users need to consume carbon dioxide through their movements (kinect for motion capture).
